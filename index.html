            <p> Hi, I am Mahmudul Hassan Fuad. I am a web developer. I starting eb develpement since from my university
                life but
                not get in to it at the forst time.
                Now after realizing that it is a grate opportunities for to earn and lead a good standard life, i take
                it as a
                passion. Web development is fun it is not easy
                because nothing which has a higher price is easy. we have to secrifice one good for other. But I think
                this is
                worth of it. Anyway that was just my thought.
                In a word, I love web-developing.
            </p>
